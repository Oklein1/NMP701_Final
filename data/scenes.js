For contemporary map-makers we deal with arithmetic collection of data representing points along a raster grid. We perform arithmetic transformations on such data in order to visualize them spherically. But this was not always the case, for points were not derived from storage in memory, but from the stars. Let us look a bit closer into this matter from two points of view: functinoality and theology",

        "In the mid-17th century, Andreas Cellarius, a Dutch mathematician and geographer, compiled a lavish celestial atlas. The Harmonia Macrocosmica covered 1500 years of astronomical theory. It begins with Ptolemy’s Almagest star catalog from 150 A.D., the oldest surviving comprehensive document of celestial motion. 'The Macrocosmica' then describes the renaissance theories of Nicolaus Copernicus, who’s 1543 book On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres made the dramatic statement that the earth orbited the sun, and became a cornerstone of the scientific revolution. The Macrocosmica continues to catelog Tyco Brahe’s planisphere — a “geo-heliocentric” system where the Sun and Moon orbit the Earth, and the other planets orbit the Sun.",

Therefore, every month denominated 30 degrees, as represented by the blue polygons; it's also worth noting that days and nights varied in time, and so too, generally, did the months. This is why the blue polygons representing the degrees are not exactly even. Now, each blue polygon representing 10 degrees was known as a ‘decan’; a decan was an indicator used to tell when night began; it all depended on the ‘decan’ in the sky.",

Sin, as it was said, weighted on one's soul. But weights how? Certainly metaphorically. For theologians, it also literally weighted. Drawing from Aristotle's' Physics, a work accounting for nature in all its forms, theologians harbored on one particular statement of Aristotle. In a passage describing why things go down, while others go up, Aristotle notes that heavier things go down and towards the center. And what could be more heavy than the Sins of Man?",

In other words, devoid of Sin, the soul is not weighted down, but rather arises up. Rapture.",
